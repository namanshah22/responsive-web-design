          Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS (22 December 1887 â€“ 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems considered to be unsolvable. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation, which was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became apparent to the wider mathematical community, centred in Europe at the time, he began a famous partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. He rediscovered previously known theorems in addition to producing new work.

          Ramanujan was born in Erode, Madras Presidency (now Tamil Nadu), in a Tamil Brahmin family. He spent most of his childhood in Kumbakonam, a town in Tamil Nadu. His father worked as a clerk in a cloth merchant's shop. When he was a year and a half old, his mother gave birth to a son named Sadagopan, who died less than three months later. In December 1889, Ramanujan contracted smallpox, but unlike the thousands in the Thanjavur district who died of the disease that year, he recovered. He moved with his mother to her parents' house in Kanchipuram, near Madras (now Chennai). He was enrolled in a local school but disliked attending classes, preferring to conduct his own research and exploring mathematics. When he was 13 years old, he was lent a book on advanced trigonometry written by S. L. Loney. He completely mastered it by the age of 14 and discovered sophisticated theorems on his own.
